# Data Mining (JADS, 1st year Bachelor)

Jupyter notebooks with illustrating examples. Material follows the book "Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques" by Witten, Frank, Hall, and Pal.

## Sources and advanced reading
### Practice-oriented materials
We use many code examples from the following excellent book. Warmly recommended for learning machine learning (in Python):

"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by [Andreas Mueller](http://amueller.io) and [Sarah Guido](https://twitter.com/sarah_guido). You can find details about the book on the [O'Reilly website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do>). We'll be using the included mglearn package to make plotting easier.

### Theory-oriented materials
For a deeper understanding of machine learning techniques, we can recommend the following books:

"[The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction. (2nd edition)](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman. One of the key references of the field. Great coverage of linear models, regularization, kernel methods, model evaluation, ensembles, neural nets, unsupervised learning. The PDF is available for free.  

"[An Introduction to Statistical Learning (with Applications in R)](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. More introductory version of the above book, with many code examples in R. The PDF is also available for free.

"[Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. The current reference for deep learning. Chapters can be downloaded from the website.

"[Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/)" by Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams. The reference for Bayesian Inference. Also see [David MacKay's book](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itila/book.html) for additional insights.
